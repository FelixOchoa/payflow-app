This project is a solution to a technical test, which involves developing a flow that allows viewing a product, entering banking information, displaying the purchase details, and showing the final status. The solution was developed in React using Tailwind as the CSS framework and Redux to manage global states.

The application is responsive, although it is primarily designed for mobile views.

I am **Felix Ochoa** and this is my solution.
